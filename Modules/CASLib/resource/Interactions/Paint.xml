<!-- This is a very simple state machine consisting of a single state and
     two transitions to itself. These transitions are triggered by pessing
     the left mouse button while holding the CTRL key and by moving the
     mouse under the same condition.

     The actual button/key combinations, or event variants, are specified
     in PaintConfig.xml. -->
<statemachine>
  <state name="start" startstate="true">
    <transition event_class="MousePressEvent" event_variant="MousePressEvent_Left_Ctrl" target="start">
      <action name="paint" />
    </transition>
    <transition event_class="MouseMoveEvent" event_variant="MouseMoveEvent_Left_Ctrl" target="start">
      <action name="paint" />
    </transition>
